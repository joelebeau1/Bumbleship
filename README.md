As a user I would like to...
- go to homepage & start a new game w/ user names
- invite another player using invite code
- gameboard creation & place your ships
- see hits/misses you've made on other players board
    - stretch: your own board with hits & misses from other player

- player 1 gets first shot
- player enters coordinates to fire shot (ex: A2)
- if coords have been pervisoly entered, alert player
- new page diplaying if it was hit/miss/sink, waiting on other player to fire
  - stretch: ajaxify to keep on same page
- player 2 repeats entering coordinates & new page
- repeat unitl winner

- when a winner is determined, both players are taken to a stats page
